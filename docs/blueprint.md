## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#5DADE2) evoking trust and professionalism.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#EBF4FA) to provide a clean and airy feel.
- Accent color: A vibrant yellow (#F4D03F) used sparingly to draw attention to important actions and elements. This provides contrast against the analogous blue shades. The combination of light and muted blues with a strong yellow invokes references of mid-century modernism, yet it has currency as it remains a very on-trend style for design-conscious tech firms.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts for optimal readability across all devices and user roles.
- Simple, consistent icons throughout the interface, enhancing usability without unnecessary embellishment.
- Clean and professional layout reminiscent of modern recruitment platforms like Fiverr. Focus on card-based layouts to maximize available space.
